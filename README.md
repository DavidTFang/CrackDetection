# CrackDetection
This repository hosts my code for developing a deep learning model to detect cracks in buildings, bridges, and roads.

## Preprocessing
This contains

- give example on how to ru (using code snippets and stuff with ``) (pip install requirements and stuff like that)

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Model Training
